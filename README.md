This is a minimal implementation of React and Redux to create a calculator. It's purpose is to show clean code, the most lightweight implementation of react and redux. Most of the interesting code lives in the `calculatorReducer` function which takes actions for each button press and maintains the state of the calculator.

To install:
```yarn```

To run in dev mode:
```yarn start```

To bundle for release:
```yarn run build```
Deliver ./build folder as static files.

Thanks,
PJ
